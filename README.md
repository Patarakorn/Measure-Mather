## Overview
Measure-Mather is a research collaboration between the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and Mather House that quantifies edible calories and their associated greenhouse-gas emissions discarded in the undergraduate dining halls. By combining **Ultralytics YOLOv8-Seg** and an automated image-capture pipeline, the project turns anonymous tray images into actionable sustainability metrics for Harvard University Dining Services (HUDS). The long-term vision is to inform menu design, procurement, and behavioral nudges that reduce food waste on campus.

## Features
- **Ultralytics YOLOv8-Seg** model for instance segmentation of tray items.  
- **Edge collection rig**: Raspberry Pi 5 + 12 MP camera + HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor for hands-free capture at the dish belt.  
- **Secure upload** to Google Drive via the Drive API (OAuth 2.0); HUDS nutritional data ingested from **CSV files** for downstream analysis.  
- **Carbon accounting**: converts predicted portions into calories and CO‚ÇÇ-equivalent using values from Our World in Data.
